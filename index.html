      <p >
        I lead a colorful life with a lot of creep and jump scares.
        I have done a lot of different things in the past and I am not afraid to change again.<br />
        I have got a positive attitude (quarter-full) and am not easily scared.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have solid experience in Linux administration and basic experience in programming small-scale web applications.<br />
        I am experienced in using version control, bugtrackers and wikis for development and am eager to learn more about Test-driven development and Continuous integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have first-hand experience in interpersonal conflicts and am able to solve them with analytical and rhetorical skills.<br />
        I have a few creative hobbies giving me insight into how creative people think and work and I am manually skilled as a consequence.<br />
        In extension to creativity I also experiment with productivity patterns - you could call that <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">life-hacks</a>.

    <h2>what i am looking for</h2>
    <p>
    We both like to think out of the box to find a <a href="http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/">different</a> perspective. We also like straightforward and simple solutions. We do not imitate <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/">others</a>, instead we try to understand and extend.
    </p><p>
    We <a href="https://github.com/brillenfux">share</a> our experiences with others and choose to participate in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">open source</a> development and collaboration platforms. We do this not just as a gesture but instead we use this open environment to expand ourselves.
    </p><p>
    We are both eager to make things <a href="http://37signals.com/">easier</a> to understand and more secure to use. Systems can only be secure if people understand and like to use them. It's a matter of incentives not restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are several fields of improvement I am working on:<br />
    First of all I find everything about <a href="https://www.livemocha.com">communication</a> exciting, be it between people or between man and machines. Trying to figure this out helps me with people but also with ergonomics and security.<br />
    Then there is the vast domain of <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">security</a>. I like to see any security as a system and most of the time it is vast and incomprehensible. That is why we need more interdisciplinary work on this - everything is entangled.<br />
    And of course improving my <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">self-organization</a> plays a big role, too.
    </p><p>
    For the near future I am searching for a web development project that lets me combine communication, security, ergonomics and organization in a neat user interface.

      I was using the following technologies to create this page:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5</a></dt>
        <dd>A lot of it might actually be HTML 4 but I strife to make it better. And with better I usually mean better semantics and not so much better graphics.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a></dt>
        <dd>Although the state of microformats is somewhat in limbo I liked the idea of integrating them into this page. A resume is generally a heavily structured document where semantic markup seems really appropriate.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">CSS3</a></dt>
        <dd>Because this page relies on semanticization instead of graphical design, any layout and design has to come from Cascading Stylesheets. There are still loopholes however as I am still learning how to do this better.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262-arch.htm">Javascript</a></dt>
        <dd>Although my focus in programming right now is on Javascript I tried to use none of it on this page. It did not work out however: I still need a jQuery scroll script for the static header. But I did not do anything myself here.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></dt>
        <dd>The workflow is crappy but it gets the job done. I am usually using it just for vector-based icons. The overall goal here however is to get rid of the bitmaps for the most part.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a></dt>
        <dd>This is actually a test-run and it might turn out that I still like Vim. I am usually doing everything else with Vim.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a></dt>
        <dd>I am using git for a lot of other stuff already so it just made a lot of sense</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://github.com/resmo/git-ftp">git-ftp</a></dt>
        <dd>The nice thing about this tool, other than working with git, is that it uploads only the changed files.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html">Bash</a></dt>
        <dd>Since I am primarily developing on and for linux machines (servers and Android) I am using the Bash extensively. I am however a bad bash programmer and still amazed by the amount of useful features it has.</dd>
      <dt><a href="">Ubuntu</a></dt>
        <dd>I am using Ubuntu 10.4 on my notebook right now. I have a Windows 7 partition mostly for games. I will however change the linux distribution freely, I am no Ubuntu advocate.</dd>
      <dt><a href="">Linux</a></dt>
        <dd>The list will have to end with Linux: it is my main operating system for years now - on the desktop as well as on servers. You still cannot expect everything to "just run" and there is no working graphical environment (at least none worth mentioning) but it is making it more than up with transparency and maintainability. I do not think I will ever change it.</dd>
