    <h2>what we should have in common</h2>
    <p>
    We both like to think out of the box to find a <a href="http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/">different</a> perspective. We also like straightforward and simple solutions. We do not imitate <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/">others</a>, instead we try to understand and extend.
    </p><p>
    We <a href="https://github.com/brillenfux">share</a> our experiences with others and choose to participate in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">open source</a> development and collaboration platforms. We do this not just as a gesture but instead we use this open environment to expand ourselves.
    </p><p>
    We are both eager to make things <a href="http://37signals.com/">easier</a> to understand and more secure to use. Systems can only be secure if people understand and like to use them. It's a matter of incentives not restrictions.

    <h2>what i can do</h2>
    <p>
    I am working on small-scale web projects on the <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html">LAMPP</a> stack, the latest one is a mobile web application. I am pretty good at administrating <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>-based Linux systems and I find my way around RedHat-based ones as well. I also know the basics of the Apache httpd and I can also do some MySQL administration.<br />
    I do most of my PHP programming with <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> but I have used micro-frameworks like <a href="http://www.limonade-php.net/">Limonade</a> as well. My web applications rely on HTML5 and the Ajax libraries <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and jQuery Mobile.<br />
    I am organizing my projects with wikis, issue trackers and revision control systems.
    </p><p>
    I am straightforward and not afraid talking about touchy issues but I always have a very constructive and polite approach towards it. I am also very open to others and can take constructive criticism pretty well.<br />
    If there is a conflict I tend to <a href="http://www.schulz-von-thun.de/">analyze</a> it and resolve it by exchanging perspectives, if people need guidance I can often provide that as well.<br />
    </p><p>
    I like to get <a href="http://ficly.com/">creative</a> and although I think this is clearly not my major domain I think I got some insight into the whys and whens of creative people. I do some graphics myself sometimes but it is really just a hobby. 
    </p><p>
    I follow <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">Getting Things Done</a> as an organizational pattern. I am not a fanboy but I learned to appreciate it a lot. I am also trying out <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">lifehacks</a> as I see fit. I think of it as just an extension to my overall <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">do-it-yourself</a> approach.<br />
    Not everything about organization is fancy and exciting though but some things just have to be done, right?

  <div id="part3">
    <h2>what i am looking for</h2>
    <p>
    There are several fields of improvement I am working on:<br />
    First of all I find everything about <a href="https://www.livemocha.com">communication</a> exciting, be it between people or between man and machines. Trying to figure this out helps me with people but also with ergonomics and security.<br />
    Then there is the vast domain of <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">security</a>. I like to see any security as a system and most of the time it is vast and incomprehensible. That is why we need more interdisciplinary work on this - everything is entangled.<br />
    And of course improving my <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">self-organization</a> plays a big role, too.
    </p><p>
    For the near future I am searching for a web development project that lets me combine communication, security, ergonomics and organization in a neat user interface.

  <div id="part4">
    <h2>how we team up</h2>
    <p>
    If you think we have common views, I can do what you need and you want to do what I am looking for then contact me. I think it still works best to email me but I am also participating in social networking services.
